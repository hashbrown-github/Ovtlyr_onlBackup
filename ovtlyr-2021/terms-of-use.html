This Agreement is a license to use, and not a contract of sale for, the Licensed Product. All Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Licensed Product are retained by Licensor.

             <p>4. Confidentiality</p>
             <p>(a) As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means: all information, including, but not limited to, the trade secrets and know-how of the respective Parties, any information marked "Confidential" or "Proprietary" and, in the case of Licensor, the Licensed Product; provided, however, Confidential Information shall not mean any information that:</p>
             <p>(i) is known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing Party;</p>
             <p>(ii) is developed independently by the receiving Party without use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information;</p>
             <p>(iii) is within, or later falls within, the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party;</p>
             <p>(iv) is publicly disclosed with written approval of the disclosing Party; or </p>
             <p>(v) becomes lawfully known or available to the receiving Party without restriction from a source having the lawful right to disclose the information without breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party.</p>
             <p>The receiving Party shall have the burden of proof as to establishing by competent evidence any of the exceptions set forth in (i) to (v) above. </p>
             <p>(b) In the event the receiving Party is legally requested or compelled in any form to disclose any of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the receiving Party, unless prohibited by applicable law, shall provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request, so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or pursue other appropriate remedies to protect the confidentiality of its information. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the receiving Party, upon the opinion of its counsel, is legally required to furnish. The receiving Party will reasonably assist the disclosing Party in its efforts to obtain a protective order or other remedies to protect or limit the disclosure of the information subject to the request. </p>
             <p>(c) Each Party acknowledges that in the performance of this Agreement a Party may receive Confidential Information from a disclosing Party and that such Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the disclosing Party. The receiving Party agrees to hold the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party in strict confidence in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. A receiving Party </p>
             <p>(i) shall not permit or suffer its employees or agents to remove any proprietary or other legends or restrictive notices contained or included in any Confidential Information provided by the disclosing Party; </p>
             <p>(ii) shall not permit or suffer its employees or agents to copy or modify any Confidential Information except as specifically authorized in this Agreement; </p>
             <p>(iii) shall not disclose any Confidential Information to a third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party; </p>
             <p>(iv) shall only use the disclosing Party’s Confidential information for purposes of performing its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not otherwise use the information for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party; and </p>
             <p>(v) agrees to keep secure and maintain the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party in a manner no less protective than that used to maintain the confidentiality of the receiving Party's own Confidential Information. </p>
             <p>(d) Limitation on Disclosure. A receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees or agents under the control and direction of the receiving Party only in the normal course of business and on a need to know basis within the scope and purpose of this Agreement. Provided, however, prior to any disclosure all such agents shall have entered into written agreements with the receiving Party requiring such agents to treat and use all such Confidential Information in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, no licenses under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights of either Party are granted. </p>
             <p>(e) Return of Confidential Information. Upon any termination, cancellation, or rescission of this Agreement, a receiving Party shall, at the option of the disclosing Party: (i) surrender and deliver all Confidential Information of the other Party, including all copies thereof; or (ii) destroy the Confidential Information and all copies thereof and provide satisfactory evidence of such destruction to the disclosing Party within one (1) month following termination. </p>
             <p>(f) Disclosure of Software Constitutes Incurable Material Breach. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any disclosure of the Software to a third party in violation of the terms of this Agreement constitutes a material, incurable breach of this Agreement and shall result in the automatic termination of this Agreement and the immediate termination of all licenses granted to Licensee by this Agreement, in the sole discretion of the Licensor. Licensee further agrees that it shall be strictly liable for all damages to Licensor that result from any disclosure of the Software to any third party </p>
             <h3 class="heading-terms">IX. Data Subscriptions and Payment</h3>

If User is required to deduct or withhold any tax, User must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay Kievanos the full amount of payment due as if there were no deduction or withholding.</p>  
             <h3 class="heading-terms">X. Limitations and Prohibited Use of Kievanos</h3>  
             <p>AAs an expressed condition of using Kievanos, User agrees to not use the website and/or software and/or the Information and/or Kievanos Services for any purpose that is unlawful or that is prohibited by these conditions and terms.

             <h3 class="heading-terms">XI. Restriction on and/or Termination of Access</h3>

             <p>2. Termination. There is no Early Termination; No Refunds. The Subscription Term will end on the expiration date and User cannot cancel it before its expiration. Kievanos does not provide refunds if User decides to stop using Kievanos Services during the Subscription Term. If User wishes to terminate this License, notify Kievanos in writing. Upon Kievanos’s receipt of User’s request, the subscription to Kievanos Services will no longer automatically renew and will expire at the end of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>  
             <p>3. Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause, as to any or all Kievanos Services: </p>  
             <p class="termsSub_points">a. upon a thirty (30) days notice to the party that committed a material breach if such a breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or</p>  
             <p class="termsSub_points">b.  immediately, if the breaching party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Kievanos may also terminate this Agreement for cause upon a thirty (30) days notice if Kievanos, in its sole discretion, determines that User directly or indirectly caused or may cause any kind of damages to Kievanos, its prospects, or its customers. This Agreement may not be terminated otherwise prior to the end of the Subscription Term.</p> 
             <p>4. In the event of a material breach that is not cured, Kievanos will not have any liability whatsoever to User’s for any termination of your rights under these Terms, including for termination of your account or deletion of your account. </p>

             <h3 class="heading-terms">XII. Simulated Performance Disclaimer for A.I. System</h3> 
             <p>1. In addition to the Limitations of Liabilities described in Section 4, User understands that the A.I. System, (referred to as “Daily List”), Allocation tools, and results shown herein are for informational purposes only. All the information included herein should not be considered as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security or use any trading system.</p>
             <p>2. User understands that Kievanos is not responsible for any losses that may result from whatever action you elect to take based on your use of Kievanos Services including the Daily List & Allocation software. The Daily List & Allocation software may highlight different types of systems or algorithms from which User may choose to execute trades. Any type of system or algorithm User elects bears certain risks, along with the inherent financial risks related to investing in the stock market.</p>
             <p>3. When trades are executed in real market conditions using market orders, User may suffer financial losses due to market instability and/or volatility which may cause the market to move against User’s position. Therefore, a decision to trade in the stock market is made at User’s own risk and responsibility. It is strongly recommended that User does their own research prior to commencing trading. </p>
             <p>4. Daily List & Allocation systems assume trades occur with at least one share with no consideration for partial fills, nor increased market order slippage. Therefore, User’s actual trading results may not match the results displayed in the Daily List or Allocation panel. </p>
             <p>5. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. </p>
             <h3 class="heading-terms">XIII. Jurisdiction and Law that Applies to Agreement</h3> 
             <p>This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Texas and the United States User agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the state courts located in Brazos County, Texas, United States (or, if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division) with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with Kievanos, the Information and/or Kievanos Services, and/or any dispute regarding this Agreement. </p>
             <h3 class="heading-terms">XIV. Arbitration</h3>

             <p class="termsSub_points">a. one arbitrator shall be chosen by JAMS; </p>
             <p class="termsSub_points">b. each party to the arbitration will pay its pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the arbitrator; and</p>
             <p class="termsSub_points">c. arbitration may proceed in the absence of any party if written notice (pursuant to the JAMS’ rules and regulations) of the proceedings has been given to such party. </p>
             <p>Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees and expenses. The parties agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings. Such decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive. All such controversies, claims or disputes shall be settled in this manner in lieu of any action at law or equity; provided however, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding the bringing an action for injunctive relief or other equitable relief. The arbitrator shall not have the right to award punitive damages or speculative damages to either party and shall not have the power to amend this Agreement. The arbitrator shall be required to follow applicable law. IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE BECOMES NOT APPLICABLE, THEN EACH PARTY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE PARTIES HERETO. </p>
