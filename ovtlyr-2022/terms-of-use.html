            <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in OVTLYR, Inc. (“<b>OVTLYR</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”) and our website at www.ovtlyr.com, along with our related websites, mobile or other downloadable applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “<b>Service</b>”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and OVTLYR regarding your use of the Service.</p>
            <h4>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:</h4>
          </div>
          <p><b>BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE,</b> YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING OVTLYR’S PRIVACY POLICY [https://ovtlyr.com/Privacy-Policy] (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND OVTLYR’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY OVTLYR AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>
          <p><b>ARBITRATION NOTICE.</b> Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 19, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND OVTLYR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">I. OVTLYR Service Overview</h3>
          <p>The Service allows users to view OVTLYR’s proprietary scores, measurements, charts, graphs, and other analytical data for certain investments (the “<b>Behavioral Analytics</b>”). OVTLYR develops the Behavioral Analytics by using machine learning to model and analyze data relating to the trends, prices, and volatility of financial markets, individual stocks, and specific industries. Using integrations with third-party services, users may be able to link their brokerage account with the Service to view the Behavioral Analytics associated with their current holdings and investments.</p>
          <p><b>NO INVESTMENT ADVICE.</b> The information available through the Service is for general informational purposes only and references to specific securities, investment programs or funds are only for illustrative or educational purposes. No portion of the Service is a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by OVTLYR or any third-party service provider to buy or sell any securities or other financial instruments. You should not construe any such information or other material on the Service as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice. OVTLYR is not a fiduciary by virtue of any person’s use or access of the Service. You alone assume the sole responsibility of evaluating the merits and risks associated with your use of any information on the Service. Nothing herein constitutes an offer or a solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security to any person in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized. All purchases and sales of securities must and are made through a registered securities broker or dealer of your choosing with whom you have a contractual relationship and have agreed to and accepted such broker’s or dealer’s terms and conditions.</p>
          <p><b>BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS DISCLAIMER.</b> The Behavioral Analytics provide simulated or hypothetical performance results, which is intended for informational purposes only and may not represent actual trading. The Behavioral Analytics available on the Service should not be considered as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security or use any trading system. You understand that OVTLYR is not responsible for any losses that may result from whatever action you elect to take based on your use of the Services and the Behavioral Analytics. The Behavioral Analytics use different types of systems or algorithms which can have certain risks if you elect to use them. The Service assumes that trades occur with at least one share with no consideration for partial fills, nor increased market order slippage. Therefore, your actual trading results may not match the Behavioral Analytics or other results displayed through the Service. You understand that the Behavioral Analytics may have undercompensated or overcompensated for the impact of certain market factors. When trades are executed in real market conditions using market orders, you may suffer financial losses due to market instability and/or volatility which may cause the market to move against your position. Therefore, a decision to trade in the stock market is made at your own risk and is your sole responsibility. OVTLYR is not making any representations as to whether an account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. It is strongly recommended that you do your own research prior to commencing trading. OVTLYR does not provide Behavioral Analytics for every investment that is available on the market and OVTLYR reserves the right to change the particular investments that have available Behavioral Analytics at any time. Certain information on the Service, such as the stock or fund prices displayed on the platform, has been obtained from third-party sources believed to be reliable, but OVTLYR does not guarantee or warrant its completeness or accuracy.</p><h3 class="heading-terms">II.

Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms.</p> 
          <p><b>Price. </b>OVTLYR reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. OVTLYR will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information at <a href="www.ovtlyr.com/Pricing">www.ovtlyr.com/Pricing</a>. OVTLYR may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if OVTLYR gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. OVTLYR, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of OVTLYR’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>  
          <p><b>Authorization. </b>You authorize OVTLYR or its third-party payment processors to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by OVTLYR, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then OVTLYR or its third-party payment processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p><p><b>Subscription Service. </b>The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“<b>Subscription Service</b>”). The “<b>Subscription Billing Date</b>” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the “<b>Initial Subscription Period</b>”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “<b>Subscription Period</b>”) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize OVTLYR or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the “<b>Subscription Fee</b>”, please see our pricing page at <a href="www.ovtlyr.com/Pricing">www.ovtlyr.com/Pricing</a>. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. OVTLYR or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by [changing your subscription on “My Accounts” page] contacting us at support@ovtlyr.com. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</p><p><b>Effect of Cancellation of a Subscription Service. </b>Subject to Section 6.3, if you cancel your Subscription Service, all charged Subscription Fees are non-refundable. If OVTLYR terminates your account or otherwise cancels your Subscription Service for any reason other than for cause, OVTLYR will refund you a pro-rata portion of any unused Subscription Fees (“Subscription Refund”) within 30 days of such termination. Such Subscription Refund will be paid by OVTLYR or its third-party payment processors to the payment details provided in your account. OVTLYR will not be responsible for any delay, failure, or inability to provide you with a Subscription Refund due to any reason out of OVTLYR’s control, including your failure provide accurate payment details, the failure of any third-party payment processor, or your failure to otherwise comply with these Terms.</p><p><b>Free Trial Service. </b>The Service may include certain free trial offers of OVTLYR Pro (“<b>Free Trial</b>”) for a period of time communicated with the free trial offer (“<b>Free Trial Period</b>”). The Free Trial will begin on the date that you accept the Free Trial offer and will expire at the earlier of (a) the end of the Free Trial Period, and (b) cancellation of the Free Trial. If you do not provide your billing information during the Free Trial Period, then at the end of the Free Trial Period you will lose access to the OVTLYR Pro features. If you provide your credit card information during the Free Trial Period, the associated OVTLYR Pro Subscription Service will automatically renew at its then-current Subscription Fee with no further action from you, until cancelled. You may cancel the Free Trial and the automatic renewal of the associated Subscription Service at any time prior to the end of the Free Trial Period by [changing your subscription on “My Accounts” page] contacting us at support@ovtlyr.com. If you provide billing information, you must cancel your Free Trial before it renews in order to avoid billing of the Subscription Fee to your account.</p><p><b>Delinquent Accounts. </b>OVTLYR may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then OVTLYR reserves the right to delete your account and any information or User Content (defined below) associated with your account without any liability to you.</p><h3 class="heading-terms">V.

          <p>Email: support@ovtlyr.com</p><p><b>Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. </b>If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a written “<b>Notification of Claimed Infringement</b>” to the Designated Agent identified above containing the following information:</p>
          <p>(a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed;</p>
          <p>1. a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;</p>
          <p>(b) a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Service;</p>

          <p>3. a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.</p>
          <p>Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by OVTLYR with the user alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to OVTLYR making such disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.</p>
          <p><b>Repeat Infringers. </b>OVTLYR’s policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that OVTLYR believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Service by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. OVTLYR will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by OVTLYR to be repeat infringers. OVTLYR reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion.</p>
          <p><b>Counter Notification. </b>If you receive a notification from OVTLYR that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide OVTLYR with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to OVTLYR’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 13.2, and include substantially the following information:</p>
          <p>(a) your physical or electronic signature;</p><p>1. dentification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</p>
          <p>(b) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</p>
          <p>2. your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which OVTLYR may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 13.2 above or an agent of that person.</p>
          <p>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</p>
          <p><b>Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. </b>If you submit a Counter Notification to OVTLYR in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then OVTLYR will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that OVTLYR will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and OVTLYR will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless OVTLYR’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on OVTLYR’s system or network.</p>
          <p><b>False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. </b>The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [OVTLYR] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” OVTLYR reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.</p>
          <p><b>Modification of Terms. </b>We may, from time to time, change these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Revisions will be effective immediately except that, for existing users, material revisions will be effective 30 days after posting or notice to you of the revisions unless otherwise stated. We may require that you accept modified Terms in order to continue to use the Service.

          <p>THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. OVTLYR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (a) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (b) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE.

          <p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR OVTLYR ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE OVTLYR ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

OVTLYR does not disclaim any warranty or other right that OVTLYR is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">XIII. Limitation of Liability</h3> 
          <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE OVTLYR ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OVTLYR ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE</p>

          <h3 class="heading-terms">XIV. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3> 
          <p><b>Generally. </b>Except as described in Section 19.2 and 19.3, you and OVTLYR agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OVTLYR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
          <p><b>Exceptions. </b>Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p> 
          <p><b>Opt-Out. </b>If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to OVTLYR, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 5830 Granite Parkway, Suite 100, Plano, Texas 75024 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“<b>Opt-Out Notice</b>”). Once OVTLYR receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 20.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p>
          <p><b>Arbitrator. </b>This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting OVTLYR.</p>
          <p><b>Commencing Arbitration. </b>Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<b>Notice of Arbitration</b>”). OVTLYR’s address for Notice is: OVTLYR, Inc., 5830 Granite Parkway, Suite 100, Plano, Texas 75024. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“<b>Demand</b>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or OVTLYR may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, OVTLYR will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the OVTLYR has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</p>
          <p><b>Arbitration Proceedings. </b>Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your [residence/billing address] unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your [residence/billing address]. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or OVTLYR must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>
          <p><b>Arbitration Relief. </b>Except as provided in Section 19.8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by OVTLYR before an arbitrator was selected, OVTLYR will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
          <p><b>No Class Actions. </b>YOU AND OVTLYR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OVTLYR agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
          <p><b>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. </b>If OVTLYR makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to OVTLYR’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with OVTLYR will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
          <p><b>Enforceability. </b>If Section 19.8 or the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, or if OVTLYR receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">XV. Miscellaneous</h3> 
          <p><b>General Terms. </b>These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and OVTLYR regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.
